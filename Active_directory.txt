Analysis

This algorithm uses recursion to go through all the groups present within a group to find out whether a particular
user is present or not. The function return False if its not there and True if the user is present.

Time complexity: The time complexity is quadratic O(n * m) where n is the number of users and m is the number of subgroups when we do recursion
Space complexity: The space complexity is quadratic O(n * m) where n is the depth of recursion and m is the space each recursive call function occupies

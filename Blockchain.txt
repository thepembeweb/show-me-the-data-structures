Analysis

This algorithm uses the linked list data structure to implement a Blockchain. Inside the 
linked list implementation, an append function was created to add elements to the list.

Time complexity: The time complexity is linear O(n) because we traverse through every node 
from 1 to n which results in a running time that grows directly in proportion to n where n 
is the number of nodes

Space complexity: The space complexity is linear O(n) where n is the input size because 
the size of the block storage scales proportionally to the size of the input.

Analysis

This algorithm uses a tree implementation integrated with a dictionary to store the letters and their frequencies as key and value pairs.

Sorting was key to this implementation and this was done using an array containing the keys which was then sorted.

The tree enabled the derivation of the codes for each distinct letter and the letters and codes are also stored as a key value pair in a dictionary for easy access.

Time complexity: The time complexity is superlinear O(nlogn) because it has a sorting function where n is the input size
Space complexity: The space complexity is linear O(n) where n is the input size because the size of the underlying array scales proportionally to the size of the input

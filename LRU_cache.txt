Analysis

This algorithm uses a doubly linked list as the underlying data structure to implement the LRU cache. 

However the doubly linked list has a linear time complexity O(n) for lookups since we traverse through every node from 1 to n which results in a running time that grows directly in proportion to n where n is the number of nodes.

A dictionary data structure on the other hand, gives us a constant time complexity O(1) for lookups and hence integrating it in this algorithm would improve the time complexity.

At the same time, the doubly linked lists have constant time complexity O(1) for appends and prepends which is also key in this implementation.

Therefore to improve the time complexity of this algorithm, the dictionary data structure was integrated to access the underlying doubly linked list.

For a 'set()' operation, given a key-value pair as input, a node is created at the end of the doubly linked list and the key in the dictionary points to the created node. This is a constant time operation because it is a dictionary lookup.

For a 'get()' operation, given a key-value pair as input, the value is retrieved from the node in the doubly linked list and this node is appended to the doubly linked list. This is a constant time operation since the node has references to its previous and next nodes so it can be easily removed and appended to the end of the double list.

Time complexity: The 'set()' and 'get()' operations have constant time O(1).
Space complexity: The space complexity is linear O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the underlying doubly linked list.
